# Good Notes

Good notes is a complete single page application written completely in React and Firebase. 
It is a notes app that anyone can use and extend as it is very modular. Anyone with some JS knowledge could completely add more features to this application. I wanted to have a beautiful notes app that was written by myself and contained the features and simplicity I have always wanted myself. Another reason why I did this was to expound on my react knowlegde. It was my first using react-router;

# Requirements

1.  Node.js
2.  yarn or NPM
3.  A laptop that isn't from 1998??
4.  Common sense

## Installation

```javascript
npm install 
```

## Usage

```js
  yarn start
```

When you start the application it takes you to the login page, you can either sign in or signup for an account. To do this you need to have
a firebase account and make sure you have enabled read and write permissons to database.  Ensure you have enabled signin with email and password
in the authentication tab in the firebase console.

**Import**
You need to created a config.js with the credentials you get from firebase.
It should look something like this

```js
var config = {
  apiKey: "",
  authDomain: "",
  databaseURL: "",
  projectId: "",
  storageBucket: "",
  messagingSenderId: ""
};

export default config;
```

Once you done this, the app should be ready to use using the `yarn start` or `npm start`
